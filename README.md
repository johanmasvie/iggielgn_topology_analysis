# Vulnerability Analysis of the European Natural Gas Grid using Graph Theory Methodologies

This repository contains the source files necessary for producing the results from "Vulnerability Analysis of the European Natural Gas Grid using Graph Theory Methodologies".

## Directories

- `scripts`: Python code and Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce results
- `data`: Various data compiled for use in EDA
- `IGGIELGN`: Data set from the SciGRID_gas project
- `graph_objects`: NetworkX graph objects produced from the processed SciGRID_gas project data
- `results_tables`: Pickle files with the complete results from all analyses

## Usage

Running the `run_results` file in the `scripts` folder will automatically produce all the results and store them in the `results_tables` folder. The results are already stored there for reference.
